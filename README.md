# Cool Fish Functions

Cool, mostly undocumented, fish functions.

### di.fish

Starts mplayer (`brew install mplayer`) for DI.fm channels. `di channels` lists the channels, `di <channel>` starts playing one.

If you have a premium account, enter your ID in the `premium_id` variable.

### soma.fish

Similar thing for somafm.com. No channel listing cuz hard.
